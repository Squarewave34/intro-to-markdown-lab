## 0. Set up

- download the *Microsoft to do* app
- Log in through your microsoft account
- Familiarize yourself with the environment by checking every auto provided list

## 1. Make a test task
A task is the most specialized construction that allows to keep track of what you need to do at different time intervals. In this step, you will be taught how to add a task:
- Navigate to tasks
- Type the title of the task you want and add it
- Click on the task and explore the options
- Clicking on ***Add to my day*** adds a duplicate of this task to a dedicated list for the tasks you set for the day
- Click on add a step, this allows you to break down your task into subtasks
- Other options include setting a reminder, a deadline, an option to repeat the task, adding an attachment and adding a note. You can take your time to test these features.

## 2. Make a test list
A list is a construction that allows you to keep multiple tasks that may or may not share a theme in the same place. The purpose of this step is to be familiar with making a list

- Click on *+ new list*
- Give a name to your test list
- **Optionally**  licking the three dots on the top right corner allows you to choose a color or a picture for the list's background.
> If you're using mobile you will have the option to customize this tab at the same time as naming it. You are also able to set up your own custom background

## 3. Make a test category
A category allows you to group various lists that may or not have a common theme together. The purpose of this step is to be familiar with making a new category

- In the same line as the "+ new list" button, there's a button at the far right. This button creates a *category*
- Click on the aforementioned button
- Right click on the category and select the option to rename it
- Drag the test list into the test category

## 4. The necessary categories
For the purposes of this tutorial these are the base categories that you must make:

- Projects
- To consume
- Study (Optional)

The first category is *projects*, this  category will keep track of your different projects whether work related or personal.

The second category is *To consume*. Unlike what you might think this category is not food related, it's a category that keeps track of the media you want to indulge in, to watch, to listen to, to play and so on.

The last category is *Study*. This is an optional category that you may add if you're a student. It will keep track of all your subjects.

> You may go ahead and rename these categories into what makes more sense to you so long as it fits the same theme


## 5. Make Repetitives
*Repetitives* is a list that does not belong to a category. This is a special list that keeps track of all your repetitive tasks: Taking a shower, cleaning the house, cooking, and so on. Whether this task repeats each day or once a year, if it's a task that repeats periodically it will go here.

The cool thing is Microsoft To Do will automatically add any task that is due today into your *"My day"* list.

## 6. Fill in the "Projects" category
You may add in as many personalized lists relating to your projects here. You can follow the following example:
```
In my projects list:
- A list related to one of my stories' world building topics that i must expand on
- A list with a few tasks related to a game I want to code
- A list that hold my future game ideas
- A list that keeps all my art projects and ideas in one place
- A list that covers The most important objectives I have for the month
- A list that keeps track of my secondary learning projects that I want to start one day
- A list that keeps track of work related tasks
```

~~I added this because I don't have a code to put in these block, but also because then I can also add a crossed line to explain it. Genius if you ask me /j~~

## 7. Fill in the "To consume" category
You may add different types of lists based on the type of media, who suggested it or who are you watching it with. for example:
```
In my to consume list:
- Watch with my sister, to keep track of what i want to watch with my little sister
- Things I want to read, to keep track of books and manga
- Suggested by friends, to keep track of things my friends suggested that i watch/ read or play
- Things I want to watch keeps track of serialized works that i want to watch, like anime and cartoons and very rarely live action shows
- Movies I want to watch, keeps track of movies that i want to watch
```

## 8. Fill in "studies" category
You may add a list to each subject you are studying

## 9. Personalize further
Each person is different and what works for me doesn't necessarily work for you. If you think you need a new category for a whole new thing, go ahead an add it. For example I have a category full of lists for genshin impact. Nothing is stopping you from making a category related to taking care of your pet snail or learning how to fly a plane illegally. Do what makes more sense to you and makes you feel organized.
